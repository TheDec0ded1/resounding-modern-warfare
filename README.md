# DISCLAIMER

To simplify copyright matters, the new sounds will be in a separate resource pack, hosted on modrinth. It will be linked here once I have it completely up and running, but it, or another resource pack designed for this version, will be required if you don't want missing/nonexistent sounds.

**By the way, I encourage you to make your own resource packs for this,** if the sound/feel you want isn't out there, make it! It's not difficult, but if you need tips, I'm in the Modern Warfare Cubed Discord, and happy to give guidance.

# Modern Warfare

This is my fork of Paneedah's, which will set the groundwork for more unique sounds to be added. If more guns are added, I'll try my best to add them to this version, and give them a full set of sounds. Keep in mind this is only a hobby project, and as such I won't be particularly fast to update it. Massive shoutout to the original Author: Vic4Games and his team for creating the original mod! And thanks to Paneedah for doing the footwork to allow simpletons like me to compile it.

# Latest Update

I am experimenting with adding attachments, magazines, and guns. At the moment they'll just be altered versions of existing models, until I can figure out how on earth to work the animation system __without__ manually inputting and individually testing each value until it looks right.
