# DISCLAIMER

To simplify copyright matters, the new sounds will be in a separate resource pack, hosted on curseforge. It will be linked here once I have it completely up and running.

# Modern Warfare

This is my fork of Paneedah's, which will set the groundwork for more unique sounds to be added. If more guns are added, I'll try my best to add them to this version, and give them a full set of sounds. Keep in mind this is only a hobby project, and as such I won't be particularly fast to update it. Massive shoutout to the original Author: Vic4Games and his team for creating the original mod! And thanks to Paneedah for doing the footwork to allow simpletons like me to compile it.

# **SWITCH TO THE 'active' BRANCH FOR THE STABLE AND CURRENTLY WORKED-ON VERSION**
The active branch works with emissive items on, and is generally less fragile. Once Paneedah's recode is done I'll try to duplicate all the additions into a new fork of that, but until that point, I'm not going to update to follow newer PMW commits, as they make the mod break with default forge settings.

2. Clone the repository.
4. Run `./gradlew build` to compile the mod.
5. The compiled jar file will be in the `build/libs` folder.
6. Enjoy the mod!
